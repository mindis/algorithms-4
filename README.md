## Welcome to My Laboratory :)

This repository has implementations of many algorithms in Computer Science.

### Fundamental Algorithms

- sorting
- data structures
- algorithm design technique such as Dynamic Programming

These are based on: [Introduction to Algorithms](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms)

### Numerical Analysis

- LU decomposition
- Gauss Elimination for linear equation systems

### Machine Learning

Not only Machine Learning, also Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval

- BP(Back Propagation) Neural Network
- k-means
- tf-idf
- Linear Regression
